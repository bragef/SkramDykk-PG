# SkramDykk 

SkramDykk is an open source set of tools to read data from a CTD, store, analyse and visusalise the data.
The goal of the project is that we can produce better 2D and 3D visualizations of 
data from dives so that students and teachers better can understand the dynamics and biology of oceans. 

The tools will run on a Linux server and consists of several tools to fetch, manage data and visualize them. In addition the data will be available for download via a JSON API. 

At present the server is located at [ektedata.uib.no/gabrieldata](https://ektedata.uib.no/gabrieldata/)

The work was supported by:

* Amalie Skram VGS - [www.asvgs.no](http://www.asvgs)
